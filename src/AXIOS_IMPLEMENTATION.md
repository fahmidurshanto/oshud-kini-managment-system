# Axios Implementation

This document explains the changes made to replace fetch with Axios in all frontend service files.

## Problem Identified

The application was using the native fetch API for all HTTP requests. While fetch works, Axios provides several advantages:

1. Better error handling
2. Automatic request/response transformation
3. Interceptors for request/response processing
4. Better browser compatibility
5. More intuitive API

## Solution Implemented

1. **Updated All Service Files**: Modified all service files to use Axios instead of fetch:
   - authService.js
   - dashboardService.js
   - productService.js
   - employeeService.js
   - salaryService.js

2. **Axios Configuration**:
   - Created axios instances with default configuration
   - Added request interceptors to automatically include auth tokens
   - Added response interceptors to handle token expiration
   - Set up base URLs and default headers

3. **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - Added better error handling with access to response data
   - Improved error messages with specific error details from the backend
   - Added console logging for debugging

## How It Works Now

1. **Axios Instances**:
   - Each service file creates its own axios instance with base configuration
   - Base URL is set from environment variables
   - Default headers are configured

2. **Authentication Interceptor**:
   - Request interceptor automatically adds the auth token to all requests
   - No need to manually add Authorization header to each request
   - Token is retrieved from localStorage

3. **Response Interceptor**:
   - Handles token expiration by redirecting to login page
   - Automatically removes expired tokens from localStorage

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Access to detailed error response data
   - Better error messages for debugging
   - Consistent error handling across all services

## Benefits of Axios Implementation

1. **Simplified Code**:
   - No need to manually check response.ok
   - No need to manually parse JSON responses
   - Cleaner, more readable code

2. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Access to detailed error information
   - Automatic error response parsing
   - Consistent error handling patterns

3. **Interceptors**:
   - Automatic token inclusion in requests
   - Centralized token expiration handling
   - Request/response transformation capabilities

4. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - Works consistently across all browsers
   - No need for fetch polyfills

## Files Modified

- `/src/services/authService.js` (updated)
- `/src/services/dashboardService.js` (updated)
- `/src/services/productService.js` (updated)
- `/src/services/employeeService.js` (updated)
- `/src/services/salaryService.js` (updated)

## Testing the Implementation

1. Navigate to any page that makes API requests
2. Check browser console for successful requests
3. Verify that auth tokens are automatically included in requests
4. Test error scenarios to verify improved error handling

# HttpOnly Cookie Authentication Implementation

This document explains the changes made to replace localStorage token storage with HttpOnly cookies for authentication.

## Problem Identified

The application was storing JWT tokens in localStorage, which is vulnerable to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks. Any JavaScript code running on the page could access localStorage and steal the authentication token.

## Solution Implemented

1. **HttpOnly Cookies**: Changed authentication to use HttpOnly cookies instead of localStorage:
   - Backend sets HttpOnly cookies on login
   - Backend clears HttpOnly cookies on logout
   - Frontend no longer handles token storage/retrieval
   - Axios configured with `withCredentials: true` to include cookies

2. **Updated All Service Files**: Modified all service files to work with HttpOnly cookies:
   - authService.js
   - dashboardService.js
   - productService.js
   - employeeService.js
   - salaryService.js

3. **Updated AuthProvider.jsx**: Modified to work with HttpOnly cookies:
   - Removed localStorage token handling
   - Simplified authentication flow
   - Updated user state management

## Security Benefits

1. **XSS Protection**: HttpOnly cookies cannot be accessed by JavaScript, preventing XSS attacks from stealing tokens
2. **Automatic Handling**: Cookies are automatically included in requests by the browser
3. **Secure Flag**: Cookies can be marked as secure to only be sent over HTTPS
4. **SameSite Protection**: Cookies can be configured with SameSite attributes to prevent CSRF attacks

## How It Works Now

1. **User Login**:
   - User submits login credentials
   - Backend validates credentials
   - Backend sets HttpOnly cookie with authentication token
   - Frontend receives success response and updates user state

2. **API Requests**:
   - Axios automatically includes cookies with `withCredentials: true`
   - Backend validates cookie for each request
   - No manual token handling required

3. **User Logout**:
   - Frontend calls logout endpoint
   - Backend clears HttpOnly cookie
   - Frontend updates user state to null

4. **Authentication Check**:
   - On initial load, frontend calls auth/me endpoint
   - Backend validates cookie and returns user data
   - Frontend updates user state based on response

## Configuration Changes

1. **Axios Configuration**:
   - Added `withCredentials: true` to all axios instances
   - Removed manual Authorization header handling
   - Removed token interceptors

2. **Service Files**:
   - Removed getAuthToken() function calls
   - Removed token validation checks
   - Simplified error handling

3. **AuthProvider.jsx**:
   - Removed localStorage token handling
   - Simplified login/logout functions
   - Updated user state management

## Backend Requirements

For this implementation to work, the backend must:

1. **Set HttpOnly Cookies**:
   - On login: `res.cookie('token', jwtToken, { httpOnly: true, secure: true, sameSite: 'strict' })`
   - On logout: `res.clearCookie('token')`

2. **Authenticate Using Cookies**:
   - Middleware to extract token from cookies
   - Validate token and attach user to request

3. **CORS Configuration**:
   - Enable credentials: `credentials: true`
   - Specify allowed origins explicitly

## Files Modified

- `/src/services/authService.js` (updated)
- `/src/services/dashboardService.js` (updated)
- `/src/services/productService.js` (updated)
- `/src/services/employeeService.js` (updated)
- `/src/services/salaryService.js` (updated)
- `/src/AuthProvider.jsx` (updated)

## Testing the Implementation

1. Navigate to the login page
2. Enter valid credentials
3. Check browser dev tools Network tab for Set-Cookie header in login response
4. Verify cookies are included in subsequent API requests
5. Navigate to dashboard to verify successful authentication
6. Logout and verify cookie is cleared
